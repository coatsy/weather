# weather page

This is a sample project I'm using to learn angular. 
It simply goes off to openweathermap.org to get the current weather for a 
city.

It was started by cloning the angular-seed repo

```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/angular/angular-seed.git weather
```
But, if you want to start with this project instead of the angular-seed one
you can just
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/coatsy/weather.git
```
(of course, you'll need [git])

## Deployment
Every time I push to this repo btw, [the site] gets auto-deployed to an Azure website using [Azure Continuous Deployment]

## Contact
